      <h1>How it Works</h1>
      <span>Step 1</span>
      <h2>My Secret Adventure</h2>
      <p>For the child, the delight begins when they see the magical book cover. Wow, a story about my secret adventure? Wah! The excitement builds.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="">
      <span>Step 2</span>
      <h2>Each name spells a different adventure</h2>
      <p>The letters of every child’s unique name will determine how their adventure is shaped - will they meet some squabbling elephants in the woods, an old lady selling kuih in a clearing or apple-pie making kangaroo? No two stories are the same, and only the child’s name will determine their special journey.</p>
